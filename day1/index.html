    <h3>Entanglement</h3>
    <p>
        When two quantum particles <i>interact</i>, they become <b>entangled</b>.  <br>They are correlated such that measuring the state of one of the particles enables us to know the state of the other with 100% certainty, even if we don't measure it. 
        <br><b>No matter the distance.</b>

<h3>QUESS</h3>
    <p>
        In 2016, Chinese scientists used quantum entanglement to teleport information from an observatory in Tibet to a satellite orbiting the earth at over 1000 km from the surface. 

They sent millions of photons entangled with those in the observatory. Only 911 of them were received by the satellite, called QUESS. 
These photons were used to conduct the trial, which set the record for the highest recorded distance between two entangled particles. And the first time quantum information was teleported to space.

<h3>superposition</h3>
    <p>
        Quantum particles like electrons, for example, have properties. we're going to look at one called spin. There are two spin states, spin up and down. 
 
        When no one's looking, the electron are in a mix of both spin states. This is called superposition.
        When someone looks, it's forced to choose a state.
